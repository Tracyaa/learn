# Sinatra Dynamic Routes Lab

## Overview
This lab will serve to reinforce your understanding of routes in a Sinatra application. Complete the following tasks in your application controller and get all of the `learn` tests to pass.

## Spacing in URLs

In some of the tests you might notice `%20` between words in a URL. URLs are not allowed to have spaces in them. Something like this `www.facebook.com/flatiron school` would never work as a website name. The `%` sign in a URL is called `URL encoding`. Basically, it replaces unsafe characters for a URL with appropriate ASCII characters.

You can take a look at [this list](http://www.degraeve.com/reference/urlencoding.php) for a reference on unsafe url characters, and how to use url encoding to correct them.

## Instructions

1. Create a dynamic route at `get '/reversename/:name'` that accepts a name and renders the name backwards.

2. Create a dynamic route at `get '/square/:number'` that accepts a number and returns the square of that number. **Note:** Remember that values in params always come in as strings, and your return value for the route should also be a string (use `.to_i` and `.to_s`).

3. Create a dynamic route at `get '/say/:number/:phrase'` that accepts a number and a phrase and returns that phrase in a string the number of times given.

4. Create a dynamic route at `get '/say/:word1/:word2/:word3/:word4/:word5'` that accepts five words and returns a string containing all five words 
(i.e. `word1 word2 word3 word4 word5`).

5. Create a dynamic route at `get '/:operation/:number1/:number2'` that accepts an operation (add, subtract, multiply or divide) and performs the operation on the two numbers provided. For example, going to `/add/1/2` should render `3`.
