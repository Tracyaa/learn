# RESTful Index Action Lab

## Objectives

1. Draw a get route
2. Map a route to a controller action
3. Define a controller action
4. Load instances from ActiveRecord into a controller instance variable
5. Render a template
6. Use an instance variable from a controller action in a template
7. Iterate over an ActiveRecord collection in ERB
8. Build a classical index action/view

## RESTful Routes

In this lab you will walk through how to build each element required to render a
list of students out in the browser. The RSpec/Capybara tests for this lab can
be found in `spec/features`. Both tests should be passing to complete the lab.

## Instructions

- Run `bundle install` from your terminal

- Run: + `rake db:create` + `rake db:migrate` + `rake db:seed`

- Or one-line it if you feel fancy: `rake db:create && rake db:migrate && rake db:seed`

- Create a route that is mapped to a students' controller index action, the
  resulting route should be `/students`

- Create a controller for students and have it inherit from
  ApplicationController

- Integrate a controller action in the students' controller for handling the
  `index` action

- Have the new `index` action call the Student model and pull in a list of all
  of the students with `Student.all` and store it in an instance variable

- Map an `index.html.erb` view file to the student controller and iterate over the
  list of students returned from the index action in the controller. The
  `index.html.erb` file should be placed within a `view/students` folder.

## Resources

- If you run into an ActiveRecord::PendingMigration error when you run the
  tests, try `rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` in the terminal then run the tests
  again
