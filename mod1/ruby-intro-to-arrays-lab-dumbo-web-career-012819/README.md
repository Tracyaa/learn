# Introduction To Arrays Lab

## Objectives

1. Create arrays in different ways.
2. Use array indexes to return values from an array.
3. Use methods to traverse an array.
4. Reference the Ruby documentation throughout your workflow.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Run the test suite with the `learn` command in your command line. 
3. The first set of tests will require you to build methods that instantiate and return arrays. Read the `_spec.rb` file to learn what is required of you to get the tests passing. 
4. The second set of tests requires you to use indexing to access certain array elements. Read the `_spec.rb` file to learn what is required of you to get the tests passing. 
5. The third set of tests requires you to use array methods to access array elements and perform other operations on arrays. Read the `_spec.rb` file to learn what is required of you to get the tests passing.
