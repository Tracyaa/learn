# Intro to Hashes Lab

## Objectives

1. Build simple hashes.
2. Build nested hashes.
3. Access and modify data stored in a hash.
4. Add new data to a hash.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this lab and run the test suite with the `learn` command. Pay
   attention to the test suite for this lab. The instructions and comments are
   designed to help you get the tests to pass.

2. The test requires you to create a method called `#new_hash` that creates and
   returns a new, empty hash.

3. The second test requires you to build a method called `#actor` that creates
   and returns a hash with a certain actor's name. _Read the test output by
   entering_ `rspec` _or_ `learn`_â€”this is where you will find the necessary
   information for passing the test!_

4. The next series of tests will require you to build methods that build up a
   nested hash, one layer (or "level") at a time, in a similar way to how we built
   our `epic_tragedy` hash in the previous lesson. Read the test output very
   carefully; it will guide you through building the necessary methods. At the end
   of the exercise, your multidimensional monopoly hash should look like this:

```ruby
monopoly =  {
  :railroads=>
  {
    :pieces=>4,
    :rent_in_dollars=>
    {
      :one_piece_owned=>25,
      :two_pieces_owned=>50,
      :three_pieces_owned=>100,
      :four_pieces_owned=>200
    },
    :names=>
    {
      :reading_railroad=>
      {
        "mortgage_value"=>"$100"
      },
      :pennsylvania_railroad=>
      {
        "mortgage_value"=>"$200"
      },
      :b_and_o_railroad=>
      {
        "mortgage_value"=>"$400"
      },
      :shortline=>
      {
        "mortgage_value"=>"$800"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Don't Forget!**

Remember to use `binding.pry` to help you get inside your methods and understand
what is going on if you need to debug. Remember to google questions that you
have if you get stuck and remember to ask questions on Learn!
