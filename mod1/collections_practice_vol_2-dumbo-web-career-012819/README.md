# Collections Practice

### Skills: iteration, arrays, hashes, nested data structures

## Instructions

The goal of this lab is to become proficient manipulating the basic data structures we use in Ruby, arrays and hashes.  Try experimenting with the built in Ruby and Hash methods as well as implementing your own logic to solve these.  Write methods that solve each of the rspec tests. All solutions should be generic and work for any "case".
These problems should get progressively more difficult.
