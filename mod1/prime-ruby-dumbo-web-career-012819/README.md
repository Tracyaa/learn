# Implementing Prime

## Objectives

1. Practice iteration and looping.
2. Practice defining methods and controlling return values.

## Instructions 

Fork and clone this repository. Run the test suite to learn what is required of you. 

You'll be defining a method, `prime?()`, that takes in an integer argument and returns a boolean of whether or not that integer is a prime number.

A few things to think about:

* What defines an integer as a prime number? Research algorithms for how to determine if a number is prime.
* How do you create a range of numbers? How do you turn a range into an array so that it can be iterated over?

Requirements:

* Do not use any other Ruby library. You must build a method that can verify whether a number is prime. Don't `require 'math'` and just piggyback off their implementation of prime number.

## Advanced

Think about the efficiency of your algorithm. How many iterations does it do? Look into Benchmarking in Ruby and profile a few different approaches to implementing `prime?()`.
