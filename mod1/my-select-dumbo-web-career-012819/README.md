# `my_select`

## Objectives

1. Continue to practice using `yield` and blocks.
2. Gain a deeper understanding of the common enumerable `.select`.

## Instructions

Now that we've built our own `.each` and `.collect` methods, let's build our own `.select` method! If you don't remember what `.select` does, review the [Ruby docs](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-select) on it.

Run `bundle install` first to update or install any gems. 

Write your code in `lib/my_select.rb`. Get the tests to pass.

A few things to think about: 

* What is the return value of yielding a character to a block?
* How can you ensure your `.select` method can respond appropriately to being passed an argument of an empty collection?
